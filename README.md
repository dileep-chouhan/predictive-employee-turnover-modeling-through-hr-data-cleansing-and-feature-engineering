# Predictive Employee Turnover Modeling Through HR Data Cleansing and Feature Engineering

**Overview:**

This project focuses on improving employee retention by developing a predictive model for identifying employees at risk of turnover.  The analysis involves comprehensive cleaning and preparation of messy HR data, followed by feature engineering to create insightful variables for the predictive model.  The goal is to provide actionable insights to inform targeted retention strategies and reduce employee turnover costs.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* (Add any other libraries used here)


**How to Run:**

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

**Example Output:**

The script will print key analysis results and insights to the console, including descriptive statistics, feature importance scores from the predictive model, and model performance metrics.  Additionally, the project will generate several visualization files (e.g., plots showing turnover rates over time, correlation matrices, etc.) in the `./output` directory.  The specific output files and their names might vary depending on the analysis performed.  Check the `./output` folder for generated visualizations.


**Project Structure:**

* `data/`: Raw and processed HR datasets.
* `src/`: Python source code files.
    * `main.py`: The main script to run the analysis.
    * `(other python files)`:  Modularized functions for data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling etc.
* `output/`: Directory for saving generated plots and other output files.
* `requirements.txt`: List of project dependencies.
* `README.md`: This file.
